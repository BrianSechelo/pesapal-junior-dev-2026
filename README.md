# Pesapal Junior Developer Challenge '26

This project is a simple relational database management system (RDBMS) built from scratch as part of the Pesapal Junior Developer Challenge '26.

The goal is to demonstrate understanding of core database concepts such as table design, CRUD operations, indexing, and query execution, as well as the ability to design and document a working system.

- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Primary and unique key constraints
- Basic indexing for fast lookups
- Simple SQL-like query interface
- Interactive REPL
- Demonstration web application using the custom DB engine
